      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, i am Prana, a student majoring in information engineering who has an
        interest in all fields. Apart from being able to create programs, I also
        have other hobbies such as designing and editing videos, especially
        designing clothing models. For me, designing and editing videos can
        relieve boredom and I like creativity and passion for design and
        editing. I specialize in creating unique and eye-catching designs that
        help businesses and individuals stand out from the crowd. Starting from
        logos and branding to print and digital designs.

            This design was created just to express my feelings, which is a streetwear design aimed at those who dare to be different and expressive. This collection is inspired by urban street culture, where freedom of expression and dynamic lifestyle are the main focus.
